v0.1.7:
- Add parameter "-C/--cpu-main-thread" to specify the cpu to run the main
  thread
v0.1.6:
- Replace "MaxLat-Bias" with "Max-Min", should also potentially fix
  negative displays of previous value
- Replace "Max/Min Latency" to "Maximum/Minimum"
- Added parameter "-s/--single-preheat" for only run one preheat thread
- Added parameter "-z/--zero-omit" to omit zero buckets when display

v0.1.5:
- Fix a bug that preheat buckets not cleared
- Added "--bias" option

v0.1.4:
- Remove "Variance" since it doesn't help much...
- Make "Average" work even with lots of overflowed values (though still not
  accurate enough)
- Added two new options: --workload and --workload-mem to specify workload and
  test mem size.  Also added the "memmove" workload.
- Start to record the minimum latency too.
- Prettify output a bit

v0.1.3:
- Allow "--runtime" to take minutes/hours/days (m/h/d)
- Calculate average/variance per thread
- Fix some typos in previous help message

v0.1.2:
- rewrite the option parsing, allow short options, prettier output here and there

v0.1.1:
- print a warning when --rtprio is used with a --cpu-list containing cpu0

v0.1.0:
- the initial version
